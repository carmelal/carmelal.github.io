        <p><strong>Hi, I'm Carmela!</strong> I'm not really sure how to introduce myself - it's something I'm still learning to do - so here are some questions people have asked me:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>If you were an animal, what animal would you be?
            <br/><br/>
            <em>I think I would be a cat. People say that I act a lot like a cat - the way I show affection, the way I communicate, all of it. It doesn't help that I used to meow at everyone and everything!</em>
          </li>
          <br/>
          <li>What is one thing you are proud of, but don't usually get to talk about?
            <br/><br/>
            <em>This is a really hard question for me, haha. But if you have an answer for yourself, I'd love to hear it and be excited with you about it!</em>
          </li>
          <br/>
          <li>
            What instruments do you play?
            <br/><br/>
            <em>I play piano as my "main" instrument; I also kind of know how to play ukulele (self-taught this past summer) and guitar (self-taught starting a couple months ago). I used to play French horn and consequently trumpet, but I haven't touched my horn in a long time.</em>
          </li>
          <br/>
          <li>
            What languages to you speak?
            <br/><br/>
            <em>None.</em>
          </li>
          <br/>
          <li>Wait, what?</li>
        </ol>
