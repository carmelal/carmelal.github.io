      <summary>6 Times I Have Had to Learn to Let Go - Written 09/27/2019 (Trigger Warning: mention of suicide, description of hallucinations)</summary>
      <p>6 times I have had to learn to let go:<br/><br/>
        1. When I am on the monkey bars.<br/>
        I remember one time,<br/>
        When I was in 3rd grade or so,</br>
        I got to the end of the monkey bars all by myself!<br/>
        But I was too scared to let go,<br/>
        So my friend's mom had to come help me down.<br/><br/>

    <h3>Short Stories</h3>
    <h4><em>I used to write short stories, mostly using writing prompts. I haven't written much in a while, but take a look nonetheless - this is baby Carmela's writing.</em></h4>

      <summary>That Flower, Kindness - Written 06/14/2017 (Trigger Warning: description of panic attack)</summary>
      <p>A few words. A couple minutes. One person. That’s all it takes for someone to go from screaming to calm, from hurting to healing. One kind, caring person. And perhaps that’s all it took for me to understand that no matter how much it seemed false, I <em>am not</em> my anxiety.<br/><br/>
        When you’re quiet, people don’t really listen to you - they can’t. You have nothing to say, so there is nothing for them to listen to. But when someone finally gives you the courage to speak, everyone listens. Because when people know, they understand it’s hard. They know it must be something important enough to you that you would fight yourself to speak.<br/><br/>
        The reason I tell you this is because I want to talk about the time we were at a robotics competition. I don’t know how or why, but all of a sudden, people wanted me. And they listened. I’d never had so much attention on me at once before, from all these people I looked up to and secretly wanted approval from.<br/><br/>
        As I spoke, you could hear my voice trembling, and then I couldn’t even speak anymore. As I spun around in circles trying to find scissors, my entire body went numb. I was hyperventilating, I was shaking, I could barely stand. I was confused. I was on the verge of tears in front of a group of people I looked up to. No. I could not fall apart in a moment of such importance.<br/><br/>
        I still did.<br/><br/>
        But <em>she</em> took me outside and told me it was OK. <em>She</em> found a quiet spot where I wept. I was shaking, I was shivering, my head hurt, I couldn’t do anything because I was so numb. But <em>she</em> told me it’d be OK. <em>She</em> gave me her sweater and <em>she</em> bore the cold because <em>she</em> would rather that than see me hurt in this way. <em>She</em> took me on a walk and <em>she</em> talked to me about random things because <em>she</em> saw that distracting me was the best way to stop me from hurting.<br/><br/>
        These were all small things, things that anyone could do for anyone. But it was because in this moment, there were more important things to worry about - rope wasn’t working, we had a match coming up, we had to practice. And yet, she chose me.<br/>
        There isn’t really a happy ending to this story. After we sat and talked together for a while, we went back and it eventually happened again. And it always will keep happening.<br/>
        But this is one story of how a flower named Kindness fought a monster named Anxiety. Yes, the monster is still alive and well. And yet, remember: I am a knight, and the sight of a flower fills me with hope and determination. I am a knight, and in stories like these, the knight never dies. He always emerges victorious. And so will I.

      <summary>Beautiful Awkwardness - Written 06/18/2017</summary>
      <p>If you’re awkward like me, you never know what to do the first time you interact with someone. Do you… Like… Shake hands? What if you’re small and they’re small and you’re just two awkward little beans?<br/><br/>
        Well, time to share some tips of what to do and what not to do - from my personal experiences!!<br/><br/>
        DO: Be nice. People like nice people.<br/><br/>
        DON’T: Be not nice. People don’t like not nice people.<br/><br/>
        DO: Be not not nice. People like not not nice people.<br/><br/>
        DON’T: Be not not not nice. People-<br/><br/>
        You get it. I’m not qualified to write a guide on how to make friends. How I even ended up with my friends, I have no clue. None at all. Totally honest.<br/><br/>
        But one thing I do remember is… Origami. Origami hearts.<br/><br/>
        When origami is your coping mechanism and you make it seem like you know what you’re doing, give your trash to someone else. Because one man’s trash is another man’s treasure, right? And then they feel special and you feel special and BOOM friends!!!!<br/><br/>
        What, y’all have better ideas? Because I sure don’t. I personally think it was a pretty good idea… Worked in real life, y’know. Just because it seems weird and I seem weird and everything seems weird doesn’t mean origami isn’t the best way to make someone love you. You know what I mean?<br/><br/>
        No, but honestly. In real life. I just… I was bored. In French class. So I tore up a piece of paper and made origami hearts. It was bright pink, I remember. We also had tape for some strange reason. We also had white GOOS paper. Good on one side, y’know? I made a flower-heart thing. Here, have a tutorial:<br/><br/>
        <a href="http://www.origami-instructions.com/origami-blossom-heart.html">http://www.origami-instructions.com/origami-blossom-heart.html</a><br/>
        (not sponsored, just thought I should tell you that)<br/><br/>
        ANYWAY I just gave it to my friend but my friend didn’t want it so I gave it to the random person sitting across from me and she thought it was cute and she made a little one and then yeahhhhhhh. Nice stories, good times, much love. It’s amazing what something small and menial to you might mean for someone else. Always keep that in mind.<br/><br/>
        The first time you meet someone might be awkward. But it’ll always be that way. It’ll be hard, probably. You’ll be trying to calculate what to say at what time and how to say it. I can’t guarantee origami hearts can get you out of that, especially if they’re not cute and smol and sweet like you.<br/><br/>
        But everyone is human, unless you’re talking to someone who is not human. In which case, you’re talking to someone who is not human. Either way, you’ll be awkward and they’ll be awkward but that’s OK because awkwardness is beautiful. And you are beautiful.

      <summary>Music of the Night - Written 10/15/2019</summary>
      <p><em>This is a newer one, loosely based off of what happened when a few Dev Degree students got stuck at 420. The cover for it is gross at the moment.</em><br/><br/>
        "Are you sure all the doors are closed?"<br/><br/>
        "Uh, yeah. We checked all of them," replied a female voice. "Are we doing everything else right?"<br/><br/>
        "We're doing everything The Vault says to do."<br/><br/>
        Silence. Even the silence was deafening at this time of night.<br/><br/>
        "They're asking what the situation is like now."<br/><br/>
        "How about," a male voice began, "how about we look at the building from the outside?"<br/><br/>
        "Sure. I'll let them know."<br/><br/>
        A pause. Footsteps heading toward the exit. Cries of resistance rose from the hinges as the door was pushed open.<br/><br/>
        "You got your fob?"<br/><br/>
        "Yeah."<br/><br/>
        A clang of the door being shut.<br/><br/>
        It echoed, bouncing through the entire office. Of course, there was no one there, so the sound just kept rebounding and ricocheting off of every hard surface. It lasted longer than one would imagine, much longer, but with nobody there to listen to its music, the symphony of echoes ended on a fermata, and came no more.<br/><br/>
        Pity there was no one there to applaud their efforts.<br/><br/>

    <h3>Novels</h3>

      <summary>Unwrapped - Ongoing as of 02/20/2019 (Trigger Warning: graphic depiction of violence)</summary>
      <p><em>This story, similarly to Lord of the Flies, is based off of a real group of people - my high school enhanced class. I alternate writing chapters with a friend.</em><br/><br/>
        “Are you sure we should let Kash drive the boat? It’s a boat, you know. Not just a car.”<br/><br/>
        A murmur spread across the group. No one really wanted Kash to drive; no one really trusted him, after all. He had proved himself to be a little irresponsible behind the steering wheel more than once and well, no one was really up to taking the risk. But then again, if he didn’t drive, this once-in-a-lifetime chance would go down the drain.<br/><br/>
        A hand went up, waving a little too excitedly, and everyone turned to see who it was.<br/><br/>
        “I’ll use my compass, which I just so happened to be carrying around today, to guide him. Don’t you worry guys, we won’t get lost,” shouted a slightly over-enthusiastic Jase.<br/><br/>
        Before anyone could disagree, Jase pulled out his compass and jumped aboard the modest yacht to join Kash. The two shared a wolfish grin and Jase raised his hands to high-five Kash. There was a flash of light as the sunlight glinted off the compass, which made everyone else shield their eyes.<br/><br/>
        <em>Splash!</em><br/><br/>
        “What was that?”<br/><br/>
        “Umm, my compass,” Jase said, laughing weakly as his eyes fleeted over the group quickly, “well, at least I have my phone! We can use that.”<br/><br/>
        There would be no disagreeing now - it was the choice of either going on the impromptu trip on the waters or being left behind until who knows when.<br/><br/>

        <summary>Twice Again - Ongoing as of 07/18/2019</summary>
        <p><em>This was, and continues to be, based off of a book of prompts.</em><br/><br/>
          Evera. What a fitting name. Almost silly, if you ask me. "Brave one". Did they know I'd end up like this?<br/><br/>
          Did my parents know I'd have to live every day, feeling myself fall apart?<br/><br/>
          Did my family know I'd lay awake every night, fearful of what I might have lost when I awoke once more?<br/><br/>
          Did the doctors know I'd be so lost? So stuck in my own head?<br/><br/>
          "What a beautiful girl you have," they all said. "She'll grow up to do such amazing things, just like her mommy and daddy!"<br/><br/>
          Now they just smile their pitiful smiles at me.<br/><br/>
          "Brave one".<br/><br/>
          Perhaps that's what I have to be brave about. The people.<br/><br/>
          The people who talk to me like I'm a baby. The people who won't let me do anything. The people who are afraid of touching me. Like I'm contagious. Like I'm a ticking time bomb.<br/><br/>
          Because really, that's all I am - a bomb. One that implodes.<br/><br/>
          One night, I will fall asleep, and I will never wake up again. I will drown, in open air. I will gasp for breath, I will be in pain, I will be afraid. They will give me medications. They will try to help me.<br/><br/>
          But I am a bomb. One that will destroy itself.<br/><br/>
          "Brave one".<br/><br/>
          At least I have my dreams. It's like I can do anything I want in them. I can walk properly. I can talk properly. I can move perfectly. I can gesture like everyone else. Some may dream of flying, but I dream of writing.<br/><br/>
          And sometimes, I dream about being able to do something, but when I wake up, it's the last time I'm ever able to do it. It's like my brain reminding me that I can do whatever it is, not once again, but twice again.<br/><br/>
          "Brave one".<br/><br/>
          It began with a bit of a twitch. And then I couldn't walk properly, I couldn't talk properly, I couldn't write properly. It all came tumbling down onto me.<br/><br/>
          Tell me, doctors, why am I like this? Tell me, nurse, how can we fix it? Tell me, scientist, how much longer will I live?<br/><br/>
          They don't know.<br/><br/>
          "Brave one".<br/><br/>
          Tell me, ALS, why did you choose me?<br/><br/>
